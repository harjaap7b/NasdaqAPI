## Analyzing financial data using Nasdaq API

I will be using the Nasdaq API to extract fincancial data and analyze it. The data entails a wide range financial data sets including comprehensive metrics on various companies. I will take a look at the MER/F1 datatable which contains information such as balance sheets, cash flow statements and income statements.

The extracted information will be for a set of companies, to understand thier financial progression over time. Metrics like Accured Expenses Turnover will be part of the soup of metrics being analyzed to compare and contrast the difference between each country. The end goal being the comparitive analysis of financial data to see any patters or trends and see the ramfications of those patterns.
